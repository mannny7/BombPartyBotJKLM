<h2>Prerequesites</h2>

You **must** have chrome installed and Python.

<h2>To Install</h2>

1. Download files and extract zip file
2. Run the build.bat file which will install the necessary Python libraries
3. A new chrome window will open (**this code will not inject into an open chrome it will open a new window and can only be used for >>CHROME<<**)
4. When it is your turn hold down "Insert" to send the shortest word possible, hold down "PageUp" to send the longest word possible (more versions coming in future updates)

<h2>Bug Fixing</h2>

If you getting any errors here are the main things to try:

**Make sure you have Python and Chrome installed**

The ChromeDriver version supplied with the code may be newer/older than your chrome version. Go to the 3 dots in the top right, go to help, about google chrome and look at your version number. Then go to https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads and find your version (if the specific version isn't on there go for the closest one)
